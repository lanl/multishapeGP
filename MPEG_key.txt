Key for MPEG7.npz use in Python:

Each shape class has 20 curves; classes are accessed by the first 
index when calling the data initially (see MPEG_example.pynb).

Each curve is observed at 100 points; all curves in this dataset are
typically treated as closed, but not saved such that the first point 
is equivalent to the last point.
